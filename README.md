# ArachnID

This project provides a tool for identifying spiders found within the home. This project provides an Android application with which the user can photograph a spider and receive immediate information about that spiderâ€™s species, venom status, and habitat. The identification software is based on a Convolutional Neural Network trained on images of North Carolinian spiders, allowing for automatic species classification
